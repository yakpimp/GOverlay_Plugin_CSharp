## What is GOverlay Plugin CSharp?
GOverlay has capability out of the box to display lots of information from your pc (Temperatures, fan speeds, drive capacity, memory, etc). It also contains a plugin model that allows developers to build dlls that expose new data that can be displayed. All the examples I could find appeared to be done using Visual Basic though and since I haven't written VB since my early teens I thought I'd try to make it work using C# instead. 

This project is a demo plugin using C# that others can use as a base to build their own plugins.

## Why would I use this
If you want to make a plugin and don't know where to start, this should help get your started. I find C# syntax a bit easier to follow than VB and I'm sure there are others who feel the same way.

Currently there are a decent number of developers making plugins and using the forums over at GOverlay.com to get feedback. Feel free to join our new discord server https://discord.gg/PGWW8hqMH6 if you are looking for help.
